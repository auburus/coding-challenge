# Ambassador Coding Challenge

This submission is focus on the Back-end part. I had previous knowledge and experience
in Django and in REST api development, but it was my first time using the
[Django Rest Framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and deploying to heroku.

## Quickstart

[Browsable API](https://ambassador-jordi-nonell.herokuapp.com),
([https://ambassador-jordi-nonell.herokuapp.com](https://ambassador-jordi-nonell.herokuapp.com))
autogenerated by the framework.

 - `GET /`: List of all links.
 - `POST /`: Create a new link. _title_ is a required field, _slug_ is an optional field.
 - `GET /<id>`: Obtain information on a particular link.
 - `PUT /<id>`: Update a link.
 - `PATCH /<id>`: Partially update a link. 
 - `DELETE /<id>`: Delete a link and all its visits
 - `GET /<slug>`: View landing page and increment number of visits of that link.

Example:

```python

# Create a new link
response = client.post('/', {"title": "This is an example"})
print(response.data)
# { 
#    "id": 1,
#    "created_at": "2019-04-04T10:01:29.665475Z",
#    "title": "This is an example",
#    "slug": "this-is-an-example",
#    "visits_count": 0,
#    "visits": []
# }


# Perform a visit to the landing page
client.get('/this-is-an-example')


# Check the new data on link 1
response = client.get('/1')
print(response.data)
# {
#    "id": 2,
#    "created_at": "2019-04-04T10:01:29.665475Z",
#    "title": "This is an example",
#    "slug": "this-is-an-example",
#    "visits_count": 1,
#    "visits": [
#        {
#            "id": 1,
#            "date_time": "2019-04-04T10:05:18.464486Z",
#            "ip": "123.456.789.10",
#            "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0"
#        }
#    ]
# }

```

## Code considerations

The submitted code fulfills the expected requirements for the Back-end track, providing
some extra features. Most of those features have been implemented so I could become more familiar
with the framework:

 - It counts the visits by adding up rows in a `visit` table, instead of looking up a field.
   This is a way to prevent
   concurrency problems that might happen in paralel requests on a SELECT + UPDATE query.
 - Each visit saves the following fields: `datetime`, `ip`, `user agent`. Cookies could
   have also been used to improve the process to define the uniqueness of the visit.
 - The link has a datetime field from when it was created.
 - The title link is a different field than the url (or _slug_). If the slug field is not
   present when creating the link, it is autogenerated from the title. It helps in making
   the title a field that is not directly related to the url.



This submission has purposedly left some things out, that in a longer project would
have gotten the required attention. I have listed a few of those here, and the reasoning for leaving
them out:

 - **Lack of authentication and security** There are no users, no CSFR tokens, the django's
   secret key has been uploaded to github, etc. I used the time in improving documentation
   and making sure that the code was as maintainable as possible.
 - **Pragmatic approach to testing and TDD** The test suite could be much larger,
   and cover many other different cases. I have stopped where I have because I see tests
   as one of the tools to write clear maintainable code, but not the only one. Despite
   that, as its current state it builds an efficient (although incomplete) safety net.
 - **Limited documentation and tests regarding Visits** I prototyped this model/feature
   so in a real world scenario it would now be waiting for feedback. Therefore, knowing
   that it is extremely likely that it would require some changes, I did not want to invest
   too much time on it.
 - **Django and Heroku configuration** Despite the huge effect that the correct set of settings
   have in a project, I have figured that I would be able to show my abilities more in this coding
   challenge if I invested more time actually coding than configuring it. That does not mean that
   I don't consider it important though.
